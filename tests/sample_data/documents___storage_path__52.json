The bottle appears to be made of glass and has an ornate design with a narrow neck and rounded top, suggesting it may have been used for containing liquids such as medicine or perfume. It's covered with dirt and organic debris, indicating it could have been lying undisturbed for some time in a garden or wooded area. The background is filled with darker earth tones, primarily brown and black from the soil and mulch, which contrasts the vibrant blue of the bottle. The overall atmosphere is one of discovery, evoking a sense of nostalgia or curiosity about its history and former use. The lighting is dim, enhancing the focus on the bottle while leaving the surrounding area in shadow, creating an intimate and somewhat mysterious vibe.

      "content": "The Olmsted Brothers 1918 Report on Washington D.C.’s Rock Creek Park: America’s First National Park General Management Plan\nFrederick Law Olmsted National Historic Site\n\nThe requested video is no longer available.\nDownload Full Paper\nAbstract \nThe Olmsted Brothers 1918 report on the development of Rock Creek Park in Washington, D.C., is the first comprehensive general management plan prepared for a U.S. national park. While Rock Creek Park’s status as a national park is often disregarded, the federal reservation’s 1890 authorization coincided with the first major expansion of the nascent national park system in which Yosemite, Sequoia, and General Grant also received official designation. As with these better-known examples, Congress stipulated that the underlying purpose was to create a “public park and pleasure ground for the benefit and enjoyment of the people of the United States.” \n\nFrederick Law Olmsted, Sr. was not directly involved in the creation of Rock Creek Park, but proposals for the project dating to the late 1860s were strongly influenced by Olmsted and Vaux’s pioneering work and the former’s theoretical postulations. When the long-sought reservation was authorized in 1890, its nature, location, and intent placed it firmly within the more expansive metropolitan reservation concept promulgated by the Olmsted firm’s collaborator and partner Charles Eliot. The Office of Public Buildings and Grounds of the National Capital exerted general authority and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers oversaw the initial construction of roads, as was the case in most western national parks. The National Park Service assumed responsibility with the reorganization of government bureaus in 1933. \n\nFrederick Law Olmsted, Jr. touched briefly on Rock Creek Park in the 1901 Senate Park Commission report and was deeply involved in the planning of the associated Rock Creek and Potomac Parkway, but it was not until the 1918 report that the park itself occupied center stage.  Unlike the Army Corps of Engineers’ technically oriented studies, the Olmsted Brothers report was an expansive document, articulating the underlying purpose of the park, detailing its landscape qualities, identifying primary landscape divisions and administrative units, outlining landscape preservation and restoration requirements, providing recommendations on road construction, recreation facilities, and public transportation, establishing executive priorities, and addressing maintenance strategies and budgetary concerns. It was, in short, a general management plan. And while not nominally designated as such, it preceded and presaged the National Park Service’s official general management planning initiatives of the 1920s-1930s. \n\nThis paper will summarize the 1918 Olmsted Brothers report’s recommendations, contextualize it within course of urban and national park development, emphasize its role as an overlooked link between the two traditions, and trace its impact on the subsequent development, management, and interpretation of Rock Creek Park. Many of the concerns raised by the Olmsted Brothers remain relevant today, including the challenge of balancing preservation and access, the appropriate management of urban woodlands and other natural elements, and the relationships between landscape history, traditional park prerogatives, and evolving technologies and popular tastes. \n\nTim Davis\nPresenter Biography\nTim Davis is a National Park Service historian based in Washington, DC.

Its location at the head of Puget Sound with the combination of water and mountains in every direction make it distinctive beyond most capitol cities, and what is true of the city is particularly true of the site elected for the capitol buildings themselves.”\n\nIn 1927, Wilder and White recommended to the Capitol Committee that if “some firm like the Olmsted Brothers (designs) the general treatment of the grounds, the highest results will be achieved, and we will cooperate in every way.” Correspondence was exchanged, and J. F. Dawson, a full partner in the Olmsted Brother firm, assumed responsibility for the capitol grounds. His work spanned 1927 – 1931.\n\nOlmsted Brothers’ intent was to support the unified composition of the capitol buildings; individual landscape elements were considered subordinate pieces of the composition of the place was a whole. With deft handling of vegetation, paths, drives, materials, and siting of landscape elements, the Olmsted Brothers defined discrete spaces on the campus; reinforced axes; framed views; created thresholds; and treated edges carefully. Years have passed; maintenance funds have dwindled.\n\nMoving forward into 2022, LCM project staff and landscape consultants have planned and initiated a state-wide call for public engagement on the issues of landscape stewardship and adaptation of the Capitol Campus. We are working with ASLA; AIA; APA; Master Gardeners; local Community Garden Clubs; Nisqually, Squaxin, and Chehalis Tribes; University of Washington; Washington State University; Thurston County Regional Planning; local heritage and historical organizations; Olympia School District; and Friends of Seattle’s Olmsted Parks to engage all ages regarding continued importance of the Olmsted legacy on the Capitol Campus. Political opinions vary from year to year regarding the value of investment in the campus landscape; our LCM team is reaching out to the public for their opinions.\n\nOur paper will describe public commentary and resulting guide for adaptation of the Olmsted landscape using Mithun’s 2009 West Capitol Campus Historic Landscape Preservation Master Plan.\n\nOur public outreach has heard from all ages on:\n\nSustainability goals targeting carbon neutrality;\n\nDiligent editing and re-planting of legacy landscape to maintain “rooms;”\n\nFormal symmetry on an asymmetrical site bounded by natural forest;\n\nNew state law (2SSB 5253) requiring care for pollinator habitat;\n\nOpen access to a legacy landscape while many demand fences and gates;\n\nFinding balance between parking and green-ness in the Olmsted landscape;\n\nLocations of new public art;\n\nExamples of historic trees represented by second generation George Washington Elm and recently planted Bush Butternut Tree, which originated as root stock brought over the Oregon Trail by black pioneer George Bush.\n\nPresenters\nClarissa Easton AIA joined the State of Washington in spring 2021 to launch the Legislative Campus Modernization Project, which makes the first major changes to the historic Capitol Campus since the original Wilder and White building plans and the Olmsted Brothers’ landscape planning for the new campus. Work by both firms spanned 1911 through 1931.\n\nWith a career devoted to public sector capital programs in three states, she models servant leadership and builds bridges with public stakeholders on every public project. She passionately believes that landscape and sustainability are priorities in design of public architecture.\n\n\nSusan Olmsted is a Founding Principal of SOWorkshop, a design practice focused on cultivating resilience for people and the planet. As both an architect and landscape architect, Susan’s work explores intersections between landscapes, buildings, people, and natural/cultural resources. She enlists processes of integration, collaboration, and community/client engagement toward the creation and enrichment of high performance, enduring, and beloved places. Susan has led award-winning projects for the Washington State Capitol, Yosemite National Park, and a host of public and private campuses and sites throughout the country involving LEED, the Living Building Challenge, and SITES.\n\r\n\rAI IMAGE DESCRIPTION (v0.2.2): \n            The following description was provided by an Artificial Intelligence (GPT-4o by OpenAI).\n            It may not be fully accurate.

The façade is constructed from light-colored bricks, now slightly weathered, and adorned with decorative stonework. The building features large, symmetrical windows framed in a contrasting dark tone, with one window displaying a festive wreath, indicating seasonal decor. The entrance is framed by two grand columns topped with ornate capitals, emphasizing the classic design of the structure. The steps leading up to the door are flanked by round, white lampposts, which add to the building's charm. A layer of snow covers the ground, suggesting a winter setting, while the fading light of dusk casts a warm glow on the exterior, enhancing the colors. The roofline features a slight overhang, providing a sense of depth. Some areas show signs of age, but overall, the building stands well-preserved, with little visible damage or decay. The environment is mostly clear, with a few trees visible in the background and typical urban elements like parked cars. Keywords: historical site, Amsterdam Free Library, architectural details, winter setting, preserved building, decorative stonework, vintage aesthetics.",
